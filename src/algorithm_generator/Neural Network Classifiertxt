Adaptive Complexity Scaling: Implement a mechanism that dynamically adjusts the network's complexity during training
Bias-Variance Balancing Layers: Introduce special layers that explicitly manage the bias-variance tradeoff
Multi-level Abstraction Architecture: Design a network with parallel paths processing data at different levels of abstraction
Compression-Driven Learning: Incorporate an autoencoder-like component that forces the network to learn compressed representations
Directional Feature Extraction: Implement layers that extract features in specific directions or orientations, inspired by the human visual cortex
Discrete-Continuous Hybrid Nodes: Create hybrid neurons that can switch between discrete and continuous modes of operation
Similarity-Based Attention: Develop an attention mechanism that focuses on similar features across different samples or regions
Entropy-Guided Structure: Design a network that dynamically adjusts its structure based on the local entropy of the data
Dimensionality-Aware Connections: Implement connections that are aware of feature interactions
Fractal Network Architecture: Create a self-similar, fractal-like network structure where similar processing units are repeated at different scales
